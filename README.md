This tool was developed because I lost my android phone but was blessed to have created a VCF backup of all my contacts. VCF Reader loads contacts from a vCard (VCF) file into a table which allows sorting and case insensitive searching. The table shows the surname, the first name, one email address and two phone numbers.

If its of help to you, please star so others can it.
